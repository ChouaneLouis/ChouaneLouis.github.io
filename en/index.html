      <h2>Career Development</h2>
      <p class="intro">Having attended the INP Preparatory School, I had the opportunity to complete a 6-week internship in the engineering field. These internships were enriching experiences both technically and personally.</p>

            <h3>Internship at RTE Paris</h3>
            <p>
              During this internship, I joined the DDL (Software Development Department) where I contributed to the development of ANTARES software, a mid/long-term forecasting tool for balancing electricity supply and demand on the European grid. <br />
              This experience introduced me to software engineering careers and confirmed my choice of career path.

            <h3>Internship at SERAAP and SETAP</h3>
            <p>
              Undecided between IT and electronics, I interned at SERAAP and SETAP, where production chains and electrical cabinet wiring and automation are designed and assembled. <br />
              I quickly realized this was not the field that inspired me, which led me to focus more on IT.

          <h3>Climbing</h3>
          <p>
            Having practiced climbing for three years, this sport has taught me resilience and teamwork to reach a goal, especially on difficult routes. <br />
            I have also completed ISAE training (Instructor on Artificial Climbing Structures), allowing me to lead climbing sessions for all audiences. This training gave me knowledge in technique, safety, and teaching. <br />
            I am currently active in the Gr'INP club, where I supervise open-access sessions at the climbing gym.

          <h3>Organ</h3>
          <p>
            A fan of baroque music, I took nine years of organ and music theory lessons at the Conservatory of Thouars. <br />
            Performing regularly in front of an audience, I learned to manage stress and maintain focus under pressure, which was a highly enriching experience.

          <h3>Scouting</h3>
          <p>
            Passionate about nature and outdoor activities, I was actively involved in scouting for several years, where I developed a strong sense of teamwork. Scouting taught me the importance of mutual aid, cohesion, and responsibility, whether within a group or independently. <br />
            The field experiences and group management skills I gained have provided me with a strong sense of adaptability and personal growth, shaping my character and supporting me throughout life.
